#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) because it loops as many times as n


b) O(n^2) because of the nested loops


c) O(n) because it is called recursively n times

## Exercise II

Do a binary search for f.
start at the middle floor, if the egg breaks then go lower by half
if it doesn't break, go higher by half
continue until the lowest floor the egg doesn't break is found
Runtime complexity is O(log n) as we halve the data each step
